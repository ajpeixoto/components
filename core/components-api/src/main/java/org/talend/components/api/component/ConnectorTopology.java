/**
 * Describe how a component can be connected in a job graph.
 *
 * In most cases, a component will act as only one of the following:
 * <ul>
 * <li>An input component: can only provide {@link #OUTGOING} connections.</li>
 * <li>An output component: can only provide {@link #INCOMING} connections.</li>
 * <li>A transformation or processing compononent: can only provide {@link #INCOMING_AND_OUTGOING} connections.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * However, it is possible that a single component can have more than one role -- an example is an output component that
 * can either be an endpoint in the job graph, but can optionally also provide "successful" and "rejected" records to
 * downstream components. The component can only assume one role at a time in the graph, but could provide different
 * runtimes in order depending on the selected topology.
